# Instructions to Play

You must copy the source into your Grey Hack game computer and build it there.

Pass `-h` as an argument for help.  The arguments allow you to play multiplayer by connecting to a server.

# Notes

A connect 4 game, done mostly by chatGPT but i helped "translate" it into greyscript. Took the day to create full game menu and even added a multiplayer option, though you must enter a valid ssh server credentials in the myproxy list at the top. It is terribly written because I'm not a coder.
