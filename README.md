Games to play while playing [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/).

## How To

Each game has its own way of playing, but, first, you need to bring it into the Grey Hack game to play.

For simple, one file games, you just need to copy the text into your local computer's clipboard and paste it into the in-game `/usr/bin/Notepad.exe` or `/usr/bin/CodeEditor.exe`, save it, and build it.

For more complex games, you'll need to follow the game's own instructions for it.
